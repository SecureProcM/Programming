# The following Python program contains errors related to 
# variable naming conventions and reserved words used as 
# variable names. Your task is to identify and fix 
# variable and constant names that do not follow the rules 
# and conventions for Python's variable names. The code must 
# include the error and the corrected lines, properly 
# commenting on what the problem was. When you have fixed all 
# the errors, run the program to ensure it works correctly. 

#Variable storing name of the subject/module
#1. Problem: no class name
class_name = "Maths"  
#1. Fix: class_name = "Maths" i added a underscore to the class name


#Variable storing name of first student
#2. Problem: cant start of with a numeber when naming a varible
first_student = "Alice"  
#2. Fix: first_student = "Alice" i added a underscore can not start varible name with number


#Variable storing total score for the module
#3. Problem: theres no underscore
total_score = 95  
#3. Fix: i added a underscore

#Variable storing age of student
#4. Problem: no underscore 
student_age = 20  
#4. Fix: student_age = 20 i added a underscore changed age to small letter

#Variable storing final score
#5. Problem: thers no underscore in the variable
final_score = 80  
#5. Fix:  final_score = 80  i added a underscore

# Constant storing pi value
#6. Problem: theres is no underscore in the varible of pi
PI_VALUE = 3.1416  
#6. Fix: pi_value = 3.1416 i added a underscore added all capital letter

# Constant storing maximum score for the module 
#7. Problem: theres  underscore
MAX_SCORE = 100 
#7. Fix: i addeded a underscore to the varible added all capital letter
  

# Calculation and print message
#8. Problem: 
final_grade_student = total_score + final_score + MAX_SCORE  
print("Final grade for", first_student, "in", class_name, "is", final_grade_student)
#8. Fix: i added underscores to the missing variable names aswell as capital letters
